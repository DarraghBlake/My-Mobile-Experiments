## Brief About Me

Since beginning my coding journey over 6 years ago, I've dabbled in various tech stacks in an attempt to discover what appeals to me the most. In 2017 I discovered this to be iOS Development, causing my passion for iOS App creation to explode and I immediately decided to attend an iOS Bootcamp which was a fantastic experience.

I'm constantly trying to discover interesting challenges that I can attempt to tackle with a creative twist.

## My Event - Countdown

A beautifully simple Events app designed entirely to create wonderful looking moments that you can look forward to and remember. I've built this app with a combination of Storyboard and Programmatically, something I found incredibly fun. My Event - Countdown uses no libraries and build entirely using custom code.

The App is currently on the App Store and can be found [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-events-countdown/id1499349723?ls=1).

## The Coin Tracker

The Coin Tracker was an app that I wanted to create that tracks Bitcoin pricing as the API endpoint I was working with had a lot of nested objects that I wanted to learn more about. The App is rather simple, but it did provide me the opportunity to work with a lot of small labels in a dense proximity.

Though this app is simple, I did thoroughly enjoy working on and I am proud of UI Design and the Animation for the UIPickerView. The Coin Tracker is built with Xcode and Swift 5. It makes extensive use of Auto Layout for the UI Design.

Working with the amazing Lottie library, it was great fun creating an example of a simple [App Introduction](https://github.com/Blakey47/App-Introcution-Story) story.
